### Introduction

What do the most famous stand-up comedians of recent time talk about the most ? What are their favorite topics in their routines ? Do they swear too much ?
In this project, we have used natural language processing to answer some of these questions. Here, I have started off by scraping the transcripts of some of the most highly rated routines of the comedians to doing topic modeling to identify what are the latent topics these comedians discuss in their most famous routines. The comedians that we are looking at here are listed below.
